/*
 * Create a monitor with methods Hydrogen() and Oxygen(), which wait until a water molecule can be formed and then return.
 * Donâ€™t worry about explicitly creating the water molecule; just wait until two hydrogen threads and one oxygen thread
 * can be grouped together. For example, if two threads call Hydrogen, and then a third thread calls Oxygen, the third
 * thread should wake up the first two threads and they should then all return.
