# Producer-Consumer

    Producer-Consumer is classical synchronization problem...

    The problem describes the buffer which can ststore n items, the producer process which creates the items and put it into
buffer, one at a time, and consumer process which take items from buffer and processes them, one at time.
    A producer cannot produce unless there is an empty buffer slot to fill.
    A consumer cannot consume unless there is at least one produced item.
