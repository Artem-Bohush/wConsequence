/*
 Problem describes situation in which many threads try to access the same shared resource at one time. Some threads may
 read and some may write, with the constraint that no process may access the share for either reading or writing, while
 another process is in the act of writing to it. (In particular, it is allowed for two or more readers to access the share
 at the same time.)
