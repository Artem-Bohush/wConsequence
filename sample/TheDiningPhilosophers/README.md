  The Dining philosophers Problem is classical synchronization problem

  Problem description:

  5 (N in common case) philosophers sit around a table thinking and eating. Periodically, a philosopher gets hungry and
  tries to pick up the forks on his left and on his right. A philosopher may only pick up one fork at a time and,
  obviously, cannot pick up a chopstick already in the hand of neighbor philosopher.
